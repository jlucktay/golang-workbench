# Go debug exercise

This project has no dependencies outside of the standard library. You should
be able to run the already passing tests with

    go test -v tests/already_passing_test.go

To run a failing test:

    go test -v tests/failing_1_test.go

It can be helpful to run with the tests with -v in order to see debug output.
