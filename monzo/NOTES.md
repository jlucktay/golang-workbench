# Notes

## Timing

Upon reaching feature-complete status:

``` shell
$ time go run . -url monzo.com
Pages crawled: 1225
Pages outside target 'https://monzo.com' domain: 9477

real    0m4.941s
user    0m4.246s
sys     0m2.553s
$
```

After adding unit test coverage to `convertURL()` and refactoring/adding logic:

``` shell
$ time go run . -url monzo.com
Pages crawled: 1190
Pages outside target 'https://monzo.com' domain: 8280

real    0m8.197s
user    0m4.381s
sys     0m2.462s
```

Some further refactoring in various spots across the whole package gained some speed back:

``` shell
$ time go run . -url monzo.com
Pages crawled: 1202
Pages outside target 'https://monzo.com' domain: 8767

real    0m4.982s
user    0m4.058s
sys     0m2.204s
```

Adding the relative path and HTTP/HTTPS protocol handling to `convertURL()` did slow it back down, although the number of pages covered/crawled went up significantly:

``` shell
$ time go run . -url monzo.com
Pages crawled: 2315
Pages outside target 'https://monzo.com' domain: 16805

real    0m10.043s
user    0m7.713s
sys     0m4.701s
```

Following some more refactoring around the error handling and locking section in `crawl()`:

``` shell
$ time go run . -url monzo.com
Pages crawled: 2283
Pages outside target 'https://monzo.com' domain: 16530

real    0m8.934s
user    0m7.990s
sys     0m4.663s
```

## Magefile target candidates

- `check latest error log for non-404 errors:`
- `$ cat $(ls -rt1 *error* | tail -n 1) | grep -v "\[404\]"`
- `$ go test -count 1 -v .`
- `$ time go run .`
- `$ time go run . -url monzo.com`
- `$ rm -f *.json *.log`
