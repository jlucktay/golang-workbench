# Spec

We'd like you to write a simple web crawler in a programming language of your choice. Feel free to either choose one you're very familiar with or, if you'd like to learn some Go, you can also make this your first Go program!

- The crawler should be limited to one domain - so when you start with `https://monzo.com/`, it would crawl all pages within `monzo.com`, but not follow external links, for example to the ***Facebook*** and ***Twitter*** accounts.
- Given a URL, it should print a simple site map, showing the links between pages.

Ideally, write it as you would a production piece of code. Bonus points for tests and making it as fast as possible!
