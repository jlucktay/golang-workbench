# dotfiles

The aim of this `github/dotfiles` project is to:

- parse this [dotfiles GitHub](https://dotfiles.github.io) site
- collect all links to GitHub repos
- see which language is most-used in each repo
- return the repos that are primarily Go-based

Internal design follows the pipelines pattern.
